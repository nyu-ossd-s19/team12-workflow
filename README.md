# team12-workflow
For Activity Starting on Feb 6th, 2019

I learned that there is no general gitignore, you have to select a language. I also learned where to find the "Create Repository" button on a GitHub Org. 
I learned that pull requests update you push new commits to the branch that they track -- that they are not static entities.
I learned that vscode has a great interface for handling merge conflicts.
